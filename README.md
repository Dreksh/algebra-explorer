# math

* when you are solving an equation, e.g. x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0, it is only for a specific CONTEXT
* Formal Rules of Algebra are substitutions valid for ALL CONTEXTS

    * solving an equation is performing an operation on BOTH sides and then one of them cancelling out
      * these could be tabs on the left
    * by default we want to visualise the associative rule because otherwise you end up with tall trees that are unwieldy
* creation is not the same as modification
