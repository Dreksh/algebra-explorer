      <h2>To do</a></h2>
      <section>
      <p>
      This is only the first version which we were able to complete by
      the SoME 2025 deadline. There are many features which we would love to
      do. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Tutorials</p></li>
        <li><p>Input Conditions for parameters</p></li>
        <li><p>Mobile-friendly webpage</p></li>
        <li><p>Accessibility Improvements</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      If you have any feature requests, or any issues with the tool, do create
      an issue using the link: <br />
      <a href=""https://github.com/jxz12/math/issues">https://github.com/jxz12/math/issues</a> <br />
      This includes asking to fill the gaps of our latex parser

      <h2>Associative and Commutative</h2>
      <section>
      <p>
      The first idea we want to represent natively in our tool is the associative and commutative properties
      of basic arithmetic (addition and multiplication).
      We did this in a way where we represent maths expressions as a stack of blocks,
      where the blocks on top are treated as the input to the blocks below.
      To find the value of a block, you would need to resolve the blocks above it before using the value in the
      current block.
      </p>
      <h3>Associative</h3>
      <div class="explanation">
        <img />
        <div>
          <p>
          Associative means that, within the same operation being performed, you can group the inputs in any
          configuration, as long as the order of the inputs are the same.
          </p>
          <math>
            <mo>(</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>=</mo>
            <mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>)</mo>
          </math>
          <p>
          We represented this in our visualisation as the ability to have multiple blocks above addition
          or multiplication. As well as the actions "Group" and "Ungroup" to add/remove brackets,
          which are represented as adding/removing layers in the blocks.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3>Commutative</h3>
      <div class="explanation">
        <img />
        <div>
          <p>
          Commutative means that the operations can operate in a different order.
          </p>
          <math>
            <mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>a</mi>
          </math>
          <p>
          We represented this in our visualisation as the ability to drag elements across
          the top of commutative blocks.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3>Combined</h3>
      <p>
      The effect of this combined is to be able to do both, but also to be able to group
      non-adjacent blocks by selecting them (long press), and then applying the group action.
      </p>
      <div class="try-it-out" data-target='["1+2+3+4+5"]'>
        <p>
        Play around with this example to see if you can get the following expressions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn></math></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      </section>

      <h2>BODMAS/BIDMAS</h2>
      <section>
      <p>
      BODMAS/BIDMAS is all about mathematical grammar. It is a way for us to understand the
      order that the operations should happen. But there is a subtle difference in which we
      treat the Brackets and Orders/Indices vs Addition and Subtraction. The difference is
      due to inverses.
      </p>
      <h3>Inverses</h3>
      <p>
      Let's first define what Addition and Multiplication can mean in simple terms: <br />
      Addition: Let's get <math><mi>n</mi></math> more things <br />
      Multiplication: Let's make <math><mi>n</mi></math> copies
      </p>
      <p>
      Inverses can be roughly thought of as "the same operation, but in the other direction".
      These would be the definitions in simple terms: <br '>'
      Subtraction: Let's remove <math><mi>n</mi></math> things <br />
      Division: Let's split this into <math><mi>n</mi></math> copies
      </p>
      <p>
      To represent the "the same operation, but in the other direction", it's useful to simply
      mark the ones that are inverted. This is where the "unary minus" operation comes in, where
      we simply add <math><mo>-</mo></math> in front of anything, and we understand that it's
      to be taken away. This is exactly how we got negative numbers, by using this in front of
      positive numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
      To represent the unary inverse, or simply 'marking' which inputs go the other direction,
      we add a block just below the input.
      </p>
      <p>
      Multiplication, on the other hand, does not have a "unary division". But to illustrate
      its similarities to Addition and Subtraction, we have opted to represent the block as
      a unary inverse. The text view of this will add an additional <math><mn>1</mn></math>
      (the multiplicative identity) in front, so it appears like a binary operation
      (which it is, but not how we're using it).
      </p>
      <div class="try-it-out" data-target='["2+3-(4+5)","2*3/(4*5)"]'>
        <p>
        Play around with this example to see the inverses working with the original operation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Patterns</h2>
      <section>
      <p>
        Maths has a lot of rules.

      Extensible, define your own rules! Or get someone else to!

      <h2>Extensions</h2>
      <section>
      <p>
      We've covered the basics of this tool, but we've also added a bit more topics for you to play around with.
      You can try:
      </p>
