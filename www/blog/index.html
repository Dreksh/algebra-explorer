      <p>
      Algebra Explorer is a tool that allows students to freely explore algebra without worrying about making mistakes.
      Our aim is to give students an intuition for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>&times;</mo><mn>3</mn></math>
          why does <math><mn>2</mn><mo>&times;</mo><mn>3</mn></math> go first?
        </li>
        <li>
          Why is <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mn>3</mn></math>
          different since either <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn></math>
          or <math><mn>2</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mn>3</mn></math> can go first?
        </li>
        <li>
          Why does <math><mn>1</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn></math>
          equal <math><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn></math>
          but not <math><mn>1</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>)</mo></math>?
        </li>
        <li>
          Why does <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn></math>
          equal <math><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>1</mi></math>
          but <math><mn>1</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mi>2</mi></math>
          does not equal <math><mn>2</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mi>1</mi></math>?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      We do this by visualising the notation via a building blocks representation. <!-- [to become a footnote] representing the ‘abstract syntax tree’ of the maths-->
      For example, <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn></math> is:
      </p>
      <img class="row2" src="img/1_2.svg" title="Block representation of 1+2"/>
      <p>
      Where <math><mn>1</mn></math> and <math><mn>2</mn></math> are stacked on top of <math><mn>+</mn></math>,
      implying that <math><mn>+</mn></math> <i>depends on</i> <math><mn>1</mn></math> and <math><mn>2</mn></math>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Similarly, <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>&times;</mo><mn>3</mn></math> is:
      </p>
      <img class="row3" src="img/1_2_3.svg" title="Block representation of 1+2x3"/>
      <p>
      This alternative representation shows more clearly that <math><mn>2</mn><mo>&times;</mo><mn>3</mn></math> must go first, using levels as an analogy for the dependency relationship between operations,
      similar to the movements in the game ‘Towers of Hanoi’. <!-- Add wiki link -->

      But the best part of the tool is the <b>interactivity!</b> The rest of this article serves as a tutorial with that in mind,
      and along the way we hope to reveal some insights you might not have thought about before.

      <h2>Commutativity and Associativity</h2>
      <p class="mainQuestion">How can I move around the blocks?</p>
      <p>
      Commutativity and Associativity are quite long and scary words, but in Algebra Explorer they are represented via <i>dragging</i>.
      </p>
      <h3><s>Commutativity</s> Reordering</h3>
      <p>
      It may seem obvious that
      </p>
      <p class="indented">
      <math>
        <mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>a</mi>
      </math>
      </p>
      <p>
      but this is a special trait of <maths><mo>+</mo></maths> and <maths><mo>&times;</mo></maths> that is crucial to algebra.
      Generally, functions cannot reorder their inputs. Consider the sentence
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        My friend enjoys maths.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      where the verb “enjoys” is a function with “My friend” and “maths” as its inputs. Swapping the order gives:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Maths enjoys my friend.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      which doesn’t make any sense at all!
      </p>
      <img />
      <p>
      In Algebra Explorer this can be performed by dragging blocks horizontally, just like <i>reordering</i> tabs in your browser.
      TODO: add .gif here
      </p>
      <h3><s>Associativity</s> Grouping</h3>
      <p>
      It may also seem obvious that
      </p>
      <p class="indented">
      <math>
        <mo>(</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>=</mo>
        <mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>)</mo>
      </math>
      </p>
      <p>
      but this time consider the sentence
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        I have a friend with a cat who enjoys maths.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      compared to
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        I have a friend (with a cat) who enjoys maths.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      This time the rewritten sentence does make sense (who knows what cats are doing when we’re not looking...) but has a very different meaning.
      </p>
      <img />
      <p>
      This is performed by dragging vertically up to <i>group</i>, and down to <i>ungroup</i>.
      TODO: add .gif here
      </p>
      <div class="try-it-out" data-target='["1+2+3+4+5"]'>
        <p>
        Try out some of these actions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drag <math><mn>3</mn></math> to be on the left</li>
            <li>Drag <math><mn>3</mn></math> to be on the right</li>
            <li>Drag <math><mn>3</mn></math> upwards, but with a slight tilt to the left</li>
            <li>Drag <math><mn>2</mn></math> upwards, but with a slight tilt to the right</li>
            <li>Drag the newly formed <math><mn>+</mn></math> blocks downwards</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      </section>

      <section id="inverses">
      <h2>Inverses</h2>
      <p class="mainQuestion">Why can I not reorder <math><mo>&minus;</mo></math> or <math><mo>&divide;</mo></math>?</p>
      <h3>Subtraction</h3>
      <p>
      Let’s have a look at what <math><mn>1</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mn>2</mn></math> looks like in the block representation:
      </p>
      <img class="row3" src="img/1m2.svg" title="Block representation of 1-2"/>
      <p>
      You will notice that there is an entire block with only a minus symbol inside it. This is because subtraction is defined as adding the <i>negation</i>, which is a <i>function</i> with a single input. Reordering the blocks on top of <math><mn>+</mn></math> here results in
      </p>
      <img class="row3" src="img/m2_1.svg" title="Block representation of -2+1"/>
      <p>
      Which in standard notation is
      <math><mn>&minus;2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></math>.
      This reveals why we cannot reorder the inputs around a minus: the full notation for
      <math><mn>1</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mi>2</mi></math>
      is
      <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>(&minus;2)</mi></math>
      and you must move the entire
      <math><mn>(&minus;2)</mn></math>
      to obey the rules of the previous section.
      <p>
      This can be confusing because standard notation removes any
      <math><mn>+</mn></math>
      preceding a negation. This is similar to how “do not” is abbreviated into “don’t” in English.
      Explicitly keeping the
      <math><mn>&minus;</mn></math>
      separate also reveals why we cannot add brackets anywhere when there is a minus involved, taking
      <math><mn>1</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn></math>
      as an example:
      </p>
      <img class="row3" src="img/1m2_3.svg" title="Block representation of 1-2+3"/>
      <p>
      Grouping the left-hand numbers results in
      <math><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn></math>:
      </p>
      <img class="row4" src="img/b1m2b_3.svg" title="Block representation of (1-2)+3"/>
      <p>
      However, grouping the right-hand numbers results in
      </p>
      <img class="row4" src="img/1_bm2_3b.svg" title="Block representation of 1+(-2+3)"/>
      <p>
      which is
      <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>(&minus;2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>3)</mn></math>,
      <b>not</b>
      <math><mn>1</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>)</mo></math>.
      Explicitly showing the minus is useful for explaining the basic rules of algebra, even if the shorthand version is usually more useful for manipulation!
      </p>
      <h3>Division</h3>
      <p>
      Division is to multiplication what subtraction is to addition: multiplying with the <i>reciprocal</i>, also a <i>function</i> that takes one input.
      The beauty of the blocks representation is that the exact reordering and grouping rules apply.
      Let’s see what <math><mn>2</mn><mo>&divide;</mo><mn>3</mn></math> looks like:
      </p>
      <img class="row3" src="img/2d3.svg" title="Block representation of 2/3"/>
      <p>
      Now where things might feel a bit strange is if we reorder the blocks on top of the
      <math><mn>&times;</mn></math>
      to get
      </p>
      <img class="row3" src="img/1d3t2.svg" title="Block representation of 1/3*2"/>
      <p>
      How would we write this in standard notation? The answer is
      <math><mn>1</mn><mo>&divide;</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>&times;</mo><mn>2</mn></math>,
      but you may notice that somehow <b>an extra 1 has appeared that is not shown in the blocks!</b>
      Standard notation also usually uses fractions to represent the reciprocal function, resulting in <math><mn>⅓</mn><mo>&times;</mo><mn>2</mn></math>, but this also still has a <math><mn>1</mn></math>.
      </p>
      <p>
      In fact, we could even argue that the ‘complete’ representation of
      <math><mn>&minus;2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></math>
      from earlier should be
      <math><mn>0</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></math>
      if we wanted to be completely explicit about what is being subtracted from what.
      These are all examples of pitfalls in our notation that can be confusing, but hopefully seeing and playing with the blocks can help students learn to avoid them.
      </p>
      </p>
      <div class="try-it-out" data-target='["2+3-(4+5)","2*3/(4*5)"]'>
        <p>
        Play around with this example to see the inverses working with the original operation.
        Can you see the similarities between <math><mo>+-</mo></math> and <math><mo>*/</mo></math>?

      </section>

      <section id="notation">
      <h2>Notation</h2>
      <p class="mainQuestion">Why do we need brackets?</p>
      <h3>Language</h3>
      <p>
      On the surface, languages are simply letters on a page or sounds you make to pass information from one to another.
      Maths notation (written maths) is exactly the same. They may contain concepts, but you mostly see
      numbers and other symbols. One of these symbols is the bracket. To understand the bracket, we need to understand
      what concept it conveys.
      </p>
      <h3>BODMAS/BIDMAS/PEMDAS</h3>
      <p>
      As we have seen from the examples in the other sections, brackets help us to understand the order of operation.
      The ones within the brackets are always handled first. If we kept all the brackets, it would look like
      this:
      </p>
      <p class="indented">
      <math><mo>(</mo><mo>(</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>&times;</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>&times;</mo><mn>4</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo>
        <mo>-</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>5</mn><mo>&divide;</mo><mn>6</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo>
      </math>
      </p>
      <p>Almost half of that is written with brackets! Let's also look at using a lot of brackets in English:</p>
      <blockquote>
      The (ordinarily sulky) cat eats (with a grin (on their (rather fluffy) face)).
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      They are now too hard to read. We need to remove some of them; and that is where BODMAS/BIDMAS/PEMDAS comes in.
      It is an agreed convention for understanding the order of operations, so that we can cut down on the number of brackets.
      </p>
      <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Order</th><th>Name</th><th>Comments</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>1st</td><td><b>B</b>rackets / <b>P</b>arenthesis </td><td>Allows for any expression inside of it to go first</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2nd</td><td><b>O</b>rder / <b>I</b>ndices / <b>E</b>xponent </td><td>Repeated multiplcation</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3rd</td><td><b>M</b>ultiplication / <b>D</b>ivision </td><td>Repeated addition (and its inverse)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4th</td><td><b>A</b>ddition / <b>S</b>ubtraction </td><td>Repeated counting (and its inverse)</td></tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
      Our example above can be fully written without any brackets, because all of the inner brackets have operations that
      would be done earlier before the outer ones. So those brackets are redundant. The only times we need to use the bracket
      is if we want to do something earlier that has a later order.
      </p>
      <h3>Factorisation</h3>
      <p>
      Factorisation is one of those cases where brackets are introduced. Instead of keeping the expression where multiplication
      goes first, we rewrite it so that addition comes first. Since multiplication usually happens first according to BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEMDAS,
      we need to insert brackets to tell others that we want addition to happen first.
      </p>

      <p>
      Click on the <math><mo>+</mo></math> sign, and find the 'Factorise' action.
      When you factorise, you change the order of the operations, and brackets will appear.
      To revert your change, either do an undo, or click on the <math><mo>&times;</mo></math> and find the 'Expand' action.

      <h2>Exploration of Patterns</h2>
      <p class="mainQuestion">What rules are we using?</p>
      <h3>Algebra</h3>
      <p>
      Maths is sometimes called the “Science of Pattern”. The key is to know when a pattern is
      applicable to the expression. This is where algebra is useful. When we use a letter, we
      don't need to know exactly what the value of it is, but simply how it can be transformed.
      </p>
      <p>
      Take factorisation for example, the requirement for factorising is that the two terms being added
      must share the same factor (are multiplied by the same number). We don't know what that number is,
      so let's call that <math><mi class="highlight">a</mi></math>. We can write it as the following pattern:
      </p>
      <p class="centered">
      <math><mi class="highlight">a</mi><mi>b</mi><mo>+</mo><mi class="highlight">a</mi><mi>c</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>)</mo></math>
      </p>
      <p>
      Here are some examples that fit the pattern on the left, and some that don't fit:
      </p>
      <p>
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>

      <h3>Topics</h3>
      <p>
      This project is designed to be as flexible as possible, and apart from the main operations in
      BODMAS/BIDMAS/PEMDAS, they are all defined by our custom topic files. They specify a list of
      functions and constants to include, and then a bunch of actions that try to find matches
      to then transform it when the action is selected.
      </p>
      <p>
      All files can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Dreksh/algebra-explorer/tree/main/www/topics">our Github</a>.
      You may notice a lot of backslashes, and that's because our plain-text-input relies on that for functions
      as well as long variable names.
      </p>
      <p>
      You can also make your custom topics to load into the webpage. You can find it in the menu.
      </p>
      <h3>Rock, Paper, Scissors</h3>
      <p>Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple example with 3 rules (ignoring the draws)</p>
      <p class="indented">Rock beats Scissors</p>
      <p class="indented">Scissors beats Paper</p>
      <p class="indented">Paper beats Rock</p>
      <p>With these rules, we can determine the winner of a competition. See it in action with the "Try it out"</p>
      <div class="try-it-out" data-target='["\\vs(\\rock,\\vs(\\scissors,\\paper))"]' data-source="blog/rps-source.json">
        <p>
        This is special because it doesn’t matter if they’re on the left or right,
        the result will be the same (it is commutative). But! switching the matches with different combinations
        will not come up with the same result (it is not associative).
