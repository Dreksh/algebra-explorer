      Algebra Explorer is a tool to help students understand maths notation. Our aim is to answer questions such as:
      <ul>
        <li>
          In <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>&times;</mo><mn>3</mn></math>
          why does <math><mn>2</mn><mo>&times;</mo><mn>3</mn></math> go first?
        </li>
        <li>
          Why is <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mn>3</mn></math>
          different since either <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn></math>
          or <math><mn>2</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mn>3</mn></math> can go first?
        </li>
        <li>
          Why does <math><mn>1</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn></math>
          equal <math><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn></math>
          but not <math><mn>1</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>)</mo></math>?
        </li>
        <li>
          Why does <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn></math>
          equal <math><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>1</mi></math>
          but <math><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>2</mi></math>
          does not equal <math><mn>2</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>1</mi></math>?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      We do this by visualising the notation via building blocks representing the ‘abstract syntax tree’ of the maths. For example, <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn></math> is
      </p>
TODO: add picture of blocks <!--
 _   _
|1|_|2|
|__+__|
-->
      <p>
      where <math><mn>1</mn></math> and <math><mn>2</mn></math> are stacked on top of <math><mo>+</mo></math>, implying that <math><mo>+</mo></math> <i>depends on</i> <math><mn>1</mn></math> and <math><mn>2</mn></math>. Similarly, <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>&times;</mo><mn>3</mn></math> is:
      </p>
TODO: add picture of blocks <!--
     _   _
 _  |2|_|3|
|1|_|__*__|
|____+____|
-->
      <p>
      This alternative representation shows more clearly that <math><mn>2</mn><mo>&times;</mo><mn>3</mn></math> must go first, using gravity as an analogy for the dependency relationship between operations.
      </p>
      <p>
      But where the tool really shines is <b>interactivity</b>! The rules of algebra can be applied on these blocks, allowing students to freely explore without worrying about making mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
      The rest of this article serves as a tutorial, and along the way we hope to reveal some insights you might not have thought about before.
      Enjoy exploring algebra!

      <h2>Commutativity and Associativity</h2>
      <section>
      <p>
      The first two <b>rules</b> of algebra we would like to introduce are Commutativity and Associativity. These are quite long and scary words, but in our tool they are represented via <i>dragging</i>.
      </p>
      <h3><s>Commutativity</s> Reordering</h3>
      <div class="explanation">
        <img />
        <div>
          <p>
          It may seem obvious that
          </p>
          <p>
          <math>
            <mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>a</mi>
          </math>
          </p>
          but this is a special property of <maths><mo>+</mo></maths> and <maths><mo>&times;</mo></maths> that is crucial to algebra. Consider the sentence
          <blockquote>
            My friend enjoys maths.
          </blockquote>
          where 'enjoys' is an operator on 'My friend' and 'maths'. Swapping the order results in
          <blockquote>
            Maths enjoys my friend.
          </blockquote>
          which doesn't make any sense at all!
          </p>
          <p>
          In Algebra Explorer this can be performed by dragging blocks horizontally, just like <i>reordering</i> tabs in your browser.
          TODO: add .gif here
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3><s>Associativity</s> Grouping</h3>
      <div class="explanation">
        <img />
        <div>
          <p>
          It may also be obvious that
          </p>
          <p>
          <math>
            <mo>(</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>=</mo>
            <mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>)</mo>
          </math>
          </p>
          but this time consider the sentence
          <blockquote>
            I have a friend with a cat who enjoys maths.
          </blockquote>
          compared to
          <blockquote>
            I have a friend (with a cat) who enjoys maths.
          </blockquote>
          This time the rewritten sentence does make sense (who knows what cats are doing when we're not looking...) but has a very different meaning.
          </p>
          <p>
          This is performed by dragging vertically up to <i>group</i>, and down to <i>ungroup</i>.

          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="try-it-out" data-target='["1+2+3+4+5"]'>
        <p>
        Try out some of these actions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drag <math><mn>3</mn></math> to be on the left</li>
            <li>Drag <math><mn>3</mn></math> to be on the right</li>
            <li>Drag <math><mn>3</mn></math> upwards, but with a slight tilt to the left</li>
            <li>Drag <math><mn>2</mn></math> upwards, but with a slight tilt to the right</li>
            <li>Drag the newly formed <math><mo>+</mo></math> blocks downwards</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      </section>

      <h2>BODMAS/BIDMAS</h2>
      <section>
      <p>
      BODMAS/BIDMAS is all about mathematical grammar. It is a way for us to understand the
      order that the operations should happen. But there is a subtle difference in which we
      treat the Brackets and Orders/Indices vs Addition and Subtraction. The difference is
      due to inverses.
      </p>
      <h3>Inverses</h3>
      <p>
      Let's first define what Addition and Multiplication can mean in simple terms: <br />
      Addition: Let's get <math><mi>n</mi></math> more things <br />
      Multiplication: Let's make <math><mi>n</mi></math> copies
      </p>
      <p>
      Inverses can be roughly thought of as "the same operation, but in the other direction".
      These would be the definitions in simple terms: <br '>'
      Subtraction: Let's remove <math><mi>n</mi></math> things <br />
      Division: Let's split this into <math><mi>n</mi></math> copies
      </p>
      <p>
      To represent the "the same operation, but in the other direction", it's useful to simply
      mark the ones that are inverted. This is where the "unary minus" operation comes in, where
      we simply add <math><mo>-</mo></math> in front of anything, and we understand that it's
      to be taken away. This is exactly how we got negative numbers, by using this in front of
      positive numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
      To represent the unary inverse, or simply 'marking' which inputs go the other direction,
      we add a block just below the input.
      </p>
      <p>
      Multiplication, on the other hand, does not have a "unary division". But to illustrate
      its similarities to Addition and Subtraction, we have opted to represent the block as
      a unary inverse. The text view of this will add an additional <math><mn>1</mn></math>
      (the multiplicative identity) in front, so it appears like a binary operation
      (which it is, but not how we're using it).
      </p>
      this reveals an important insight: 1-2 is actually short hand for 1+(-2)! This is why 1-2+3 is not the same as 1-(2+3) because you adding the brackets to 1+(-2)+3 would 'break into' the minus, so should actually be 1+((-2)+3) to preserve associativity.
      <div class="try-it-out" data-target='["2+3-(4+5)","2*3/(4*5)"]'>
        <p>
        Play around with this example to see the inverses working with the original operation.
        Can you see the similarities between <math><mo>+-</mo></math> and <math><mo>*/</mo></math>?
        </p>

      <h2>Factorisation and Expansion of Brackets</h2>
      <section>
        you may have noticed that there are no brackets in the block representation! We hope this makes factorisation and expansion easier to understand.
        e.g. simplify the expression 8x + 4 + 3(2x - 3)
      </section>
      <h2>Exploration of Patterns</h2>
      <section>

      <p>
      Maths is sometimes called the "Science of Pattern". The key is to know when a pattern is
      applicable to the exercise
      </p>
      <p>
      This project is designed to be as flexible
      </p>
      <div class="try-it-out" data-target='["\\vs(\\rock,\\vs(\\scissors,\\paper))"]' data-source="blog/rps-source.json">
        <p> Here is an example of Rock, Paper, Scissors!  </p>
        <p>
        This is special because it doesn't matter if they're on the left or right,
        the result will be the same (it is commutative). But! switching the matches with different combinations
        will not come up with the same result.
        </p>
      </div>
      </section>

      <h2>Extensions</h2>
      <section>
      <p>
      We've covered the basics of this tool, but we've also added a bit more topics for you to play around with.
      You can try:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Solving Quadratic Equations, with "Find Zeros"</li>
