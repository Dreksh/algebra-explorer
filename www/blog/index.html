      This idea was suggested by Jonny back in 2015. The thought that written maths can be written as a
      tree structure, where each
      <!-- Something about maths being a tree, where each branch, but also make it easier for non-computer people to understand -->
      </p>

      Then in 2023, Derek switches to become a maths tutor. After tutoring for a year or so, there were
      commonly made mistakes that caught Derek's eye. These are some examples:

      To help his students, he remembered Jonny's original idea, and decided to reach out to Jonny to work
      on this project.

      <h2>To do</a></h2>
      <section>
      <p>
      This is only the first version which we were able to complete by
      the SoME 2025 deadline. There are many features which we would love to
      do. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Tutorials</p></li>
        <li><p>Input Conditions for parameters</p></li>
        <li><p>Mobile-friendly webpage</p></li>
        <li><p>Accessibility Improvements</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      If you have any feature requests, or any issues with the tool, do create
      an issue using the link: <br />
      <a href="https://github.com/Dreksh/algebra-explorer/issues">https://github.com/Dreksh/algebra-explorer/issues</a> <br />
      This includes asking to fill the gaps of our latex parser

      <h2>Maths Notation</h2>
      <section>
      <p>
      Written maths is a language, and languages comes with its grammar rules.
      Consider the example in English:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        I have a friend with a cat who enjoys maths.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      Who is the one that enjoys maths in the sentence above? The friend? or the cat with the PhD?
      To solve this, English has brackets. The brackets are placed on sections of the text where
      additional information is provided, but not part of the main message.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        I have a friend (with a cat) who enjoys maths.
      </blockquote>
      <p>Now we know that the one that enjoys maths is actually the friend.</p>
      <p>
      Maths also uses brackets. However, the meaning of the brackets are slightly different.
      They are used to indicate which part of the expression should be considered as a unit
      (things that behave as one).
      </p>
      </section>

      <h2>Associative and Commutative</h2>
      <section>
      <p>
      The first idea we want to represent natively in our tool is the associative and commutative properties
      of basic arithmetic (addition and multiplication).
      We did this in a way where we represent maths expressions as a stack of blocks,
      where the blocks on top are treated as the input to the blocks below.
      To find the value of a block, you would need to resolve the blocks above it before using the value in the
      current block.
      </p>
      <h3>Associative</h3>
      <div class="explanation">
        <img />
        <div>
          <p>
          Associative means that, within the same operation being performed, you can group the inputs in any
          configuration, as long as the order of the inputs are the same.
          </p>
          <math>
            <mo>(</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>=</mo>
            <mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>)</mo>
          </math>
          <p>
          We represented this in our visualisation as the ability to have multiple blocks above addition
          or multiplication. As well as the actions "Group" and "Ungroup" to add/remove brackets,
          which are represented as adding/removing layers in the blocks.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3>Commutative</h3>
      <div class="explanation">
        <img />
        <div>
          <p>
          Commutative means that the operations can operate in a different order.
          </p>
          <math>
            <mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>a</mi>
          </math>
          <p>
          We represented this in our visualisation as the ability to drag elements across
          the top of commutative blocks.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3>Combined</h3>
      <p>
      The effect of this combined is to be able to do both, but also to be able to group
      non-adjacent blocks by selecting them (long press), and then applying the group action.
      </p>
      <div class="try-it-out" data-target='["1+2+3+4+5"]'>
        <p>
        Try out some of these actions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drag <math><mn>3</mn></math> to be on the left</li>
            <li>Drag <math><mn>3</mn></math> to be on the right</li>
            <li>Drag <math><mn>3</mn></math> upwards, but with a slight tilt to the left</li>
            <li>Drag <math><mn>2</mn></math> upwards, but with a slight tilt to the right</li>
            <li>Drag the newly formed <math><mo>+</mo></math> blocks downwards</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      </section>

      <h2>BODMAS/BIDMAS</h2>
      <section>
      <p>
      BODMAS/BIDMAS is all about mathematical grammar. It is a way for us to understand the
      order that the operations should happen. But there is a subtle difference in which we
      treat the Brackets and Orders/Indices vs Addition and Subtraction. The difference is
      due to inverses.
      </p>
      <h3>Inverses</h3>
      <p>
      Let's first define what Addition and Multiplication can mean in simple terms: <br />
      Addition: Let's get <math><mi>n</mi></math> more things <br />
      Multiplication: Let's make <math><mi>n</mi></math> copies
      </p>
      <p>
      Inverses can be roughly thought of as "the same operation, but in the other direction".
      These would be the definitions in simple terms: <br '>'
      Subtraction: Let's remove <math><mi>n</mi></math> things <br />
      Division: Let's split this into <math><mi>n</mi></math> copies
      </p>
      <p>
      To represent the "the same operation, but in the other direction", it's useful to simply
      mark the ones that are inverted. This is where the "unary minus" operation comes in, where
      we simply add <math><mo>-</mo></math> in front of anything, and we understand that it's
      to be taken away. This is exactly how we got negative numbers, by using this in front of
      positive numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
      To represent the unary inverse, or simply 'marking' which inputs go the other direction,
      we add a block just below the input.
      </p>
      <p>
      Multiplication, on the other hand, does not have a "unary division". But to illustrate
      its similarities to Addition and Subtraction, we have opted to represent the block as
      a unary inverse. The text view of this will add an additional <math><mn>1</mn></math>
      (the multiplicative identity) in front, so it appears like a binary operation
      (which it is, but not how we're using it).
      </p>
      <div class="try-it-out" data-target='["2+3-(4+5)","2*3/(4*5)"]'>
        <p>
        Play around with this example to see the inverses working with the original operation.
        Can you see the similarities between <math><mo>+-</mo></math> and <math><mo>*/</mo></math>?
        </p>
      </div>
      </section>

      <h2>Exploration of Patterns</h2>
      <section>
      <p>
      Maths is sometimes called the "Science of Pattern". The key is to know when a pattern is
      applicable to the exercise
      </p>
      <p>
      This project is designed to be as flexible
      </p>
      <div class="try-it-out" data-target='["\\vs(\\rock,\\vs(\\scissors,\\paper))"]' data-source="blog/rps-source.json">
        <p> Here is an example of Rock, Paper, Scissors!  </p>
        <p>
        This is special because it doesn't matter if they're on the left or right,
        the result will be the same (it is commutative). But! switching the matches with different combinations
        will not come up with the same result.
        </p>
