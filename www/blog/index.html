      Algebra Explorer is a tool that allows students to freely explore algebra without worrying about making mistakes.
      Our aim is to let give students an intuition for:
      <ul>
        <li>
          In <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>&times;</mo><mn>3</mn></math>
          why does <math><mn>2</mn><mo>&times;</mo><mn>3</mn></math> go first?
        </li>
        <li>
          Why is <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mn>3</mn></math>
          different since either <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn></math>
          or <math><mn>2</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mn>3</mn></math> can go first?
        </li>
        <li>
          Why does <math><mn>1</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn></math>
          equal <math><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn></math>
          but not <math><mn>1</mn><mo>&minus;</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>)</mo></math>?
        </li>
        <li>
          Why does <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn></math>
          equal <math><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>1</mi></math>
          but <math><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>2</mi></math>
          does not equal <math><mn>2</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>1</mi></math>?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      We do this by visualising the notation via building blocks representation. <!-- [to become a footnote] representing the ‘abstract syntax tree’ of the maths-->
      </p>
      <img class="row2" src="img/1_2.svg" title="Block representation of 1+2"/>
      <p>
      For example, <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn></math> is represented by this block
      where <math><mn>1</mn></math> and <math><mn>2</mn></math> are stacked on top of <math><mo>+</mo></math>,
      implying that <math><mo>+</mo></math> <i>depends on</i> <math><mn>1</mn></math> and <math><mn>2</mn></math>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Similarly, <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>&times;</mo><mn>3</mn></math> is:
      </p>
      <img class="row3" src="img/1_2_3.svg" title="Block representation of 1+2x3"/>
      <p>
      This alternative representation shows more clearly that <math><mn>2</mn><mo>&times;</mo><mn>3</mn></math> must go first, using levels as an analogy for the dependency relationship between operations,
      similar to the movements in "Towers of Hanoi" <!-- Add wiki link -->.

      This best part of this tool is the <b>interactivity</b>! The rest of this article serves as a tutorial with that in mind,
      and along the way we hope to reveal some insights you might not have thought about before.
      Enjoy Algebra Explorer!

      <section id="commutativity-and-associativity">
      <h2>Commutativity and Associativity</h2>
      <p class="mainQuestion">How can I understand the blocks?</p>
      <p>
      Commutativity and Associativity are quite long and scary words, but in our tool they are represented via <i>dragging</i>.
      </p>
      <h3><s>Commutativity</s> Reordering</h3>
      <p>
      It may seem obvious that
      </p>
      <p class="indented">
      <math>
        <mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>a</mi>
      </math>
      </p>
      but this is a special trait of <maths><mo>+</mo></maths> and <maths><mo>&times;</mo></maths> that is crucial to algebra.
      Generally, functions cannot reorder their inputs. Consider the sentence
      <blockquote>
        My friend enjoys maths.
      </blockquote>
      where the verb is the function, with "My friend" and "maths" as the inputs. Swapping the order gives:
      <blockquote>
        Maths enjoys my friend.
      </blockquote>
      which doesn't make any sense at all!
      </p>
      <img />
      <p>
      In Algebra Explorer this can be performed by dragging blocks horizontally, just like <i>reordering</i> tabs in your browser.
      TODO: add .gif here
      </p>
      <h3><s>Associativity</s> Grouping</h3>
      <p>
      It may also seem obvious that
      </p>
      <p class="indented">
      <math>
        <mo>(</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>=</mo>
        <mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>)</mo>
      </math>
      </p>
      but this time consider the sentence
      <blockquote>
        I have a friend with a cat who enjoys maths.
      </blockquote>
      compared to
      <blockquote>
        I have a friend (with a cat) who enjoys maths.
      </blockquote>
      This time the rewritten sentence does make sense (who knows what cats are doing when we're not looking...) but has a very different meaning.
      </p>
      <img />
      <p>
      This is performed by dragging vertically up to <i>group</i>, and down to <i>ungroup</i>.

            <li>Drag <math><mn>3</mn></math> upwards, but with a slight tilt to the left</li>
            <li>Drag <math><mn>2</mn></math> upwards, but with a slight tilt to the right</li>
            <li>Drag the newly formed <math><mo>+</mo></math> blocks downwards</li>

      <section id="inverses">
      <h2>Inverses</h2>
      <p class="mainQuestion">Why do some operations not allow swaps?</p>
      <h3>Negative Numbers</h3>
      <p>
      What does it mean to have -2 cats?
      </p>
      <p>
      I don't know either.
      </p>
      <!-- Starting from here -->
      <p>
      +(-..) shortened to just -. This of this as abbreviation, similar to "do not" into "don't", "it was" into "'twas"
      </p>
      <p>
      Let's first define what Addition and Multiplication can mean in simple terms: <br />
      </p>
      <p>
      Addition: Let's get <math><mi>n</mi></math> more things <br />
      Multiplication: Let's make <math><mi>n</mi></math> copies
      </p>
      <p>
      Inverses can be roughly thought of as "the same operation, but in the other direction".
      These would be the definitions in simple terms: <br '>'
      Subtraction: Let's remove <math><mi>n</mi></math> things <br />
      Division: Let's split this into <math><mi>n</mi></math> copies
      </p>
      <p>
      To represent the "the same operation, but in the other direction", it's useful to simply
      mark the ones that are inverted. This is where the "unary minus" operation comes in, where
      we simply add <math><mo>-</mo></math> in front of anything, and we understand that it's
      to be taken away. This is exactly how we got negative numbers, by using this in front of
      positive numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
      To represent the unary inverse, or simply 'marking' which inputs go the other direction,
      we add a block just below the input.
      </p>
      <p>
      Multiplication, on the other hand, does not have a "unary division". But to illustrate
      its similarities to Addition and Subtraction, we have opted to represent the block as
      a unary inverse. The text view of this will add an additional <math><mn>1</mn></math>
      (the multiplicative identity) in front, so it appears like a binary operation
      (which it is, but not how we're using it).
      </p>
      <div class="try-it-out" data-target='["2+3-(4+5)","2*3/(4*5)"]'>
        <p>
        Play around with this example to see the inverses working with the original operation.
        Can you see the similarities between <math><mo>+-</mo></math> and <math><mo>*/</mo></math>?

      <section id="notation">
      <h2>Notation</h2>
      <p class="mainQuestion">Why do we need brackets?</p>
      <h3>BODMAS/BIDMAS/PEMDAS</h3>
      <p>
      BODMAS/BIDMAS is all about mathematical grammar. It is a way for us to understand the
      order that the operations should happen. But there is a subtle difference in which we
      treat the Brackets and Orders/Indices vs Addition and Subtraction. The difference is
      due to inverses.

      <!-- ab + ac = a(b+c) , initially no brackets, but then they appear-->

      <h2>Exploration of Patterns</h2>
      <p class="mainQuestion">What rules are we using?</p>
      <p>
      Maths is sometimes called the "Science of Pattern". The key is to know when a pattern is
      applicable to the exercise

      This project is designed to be as flexible

        <p>
        This is special because it doesn't matter if they're on the left or right,
        the result will be the same (it is commutative). But! switching the matches with different combinations
        will not come up with the same result.
